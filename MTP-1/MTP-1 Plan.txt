Masters Thesis Project - 1 (Planning and broad milestones)

- Code 5 pair of numerical schemes for the Euler Equations of Gas Dynamics
- In each of the 5 pairs we have a serial and a parallel version of the same scheme
- Compare the serial and parallel performance of the schemes for the same quality of solution
(i.e. same number of grid points)
- Maintain notes and Latex report every week for the MTP Presentation to avoid doing it during placements)
